Berker B1 is the product line for wall sockets and switches, mostly used in and around Germany. Google for some images :).

In my house I'm replacing quite some bulbs with Philips Hue, and some switches with Philips Tap switches. There is no nice cover for these switches. The goal of this project is to design a cover that will make these switches fit in nicely with the other Berker B1 devices in my house.

This will be the basis for the other models. The goal is to create one that can replace any of the original ones in my house.
